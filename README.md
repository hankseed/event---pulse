EVENT PULSE-STAR CITIZEN EDITION v2

this program is still inb infancy and needs some updating and feedback from users to help make it better.
send feedback if you wish via discord to .hanksy

when the program loads it will give you 2 popups one will be a small wite box with a feather, this will be removed in the future as its not needed for the user to do anything, its purpose is part of the python widget library that creates the popup. the second popup is a file browser and this only occurs on first launch of program and it is so that you can locate and select your game.log file found within your star citizen install path.

the default install location is C:\program files\robert space industries\star citizen\(pick a version eg LIVE,PTU,4.0_PREVIEW)

once you have found where your game.log file is located(will not exist if game is fresh install but not yet launched)
double click on the game.log file in the file browser.

the program will then create 1 folder and 2 files in your appdata roaming folder.

appdata
  |_Event Pulse-Star Citizen Edition
	|_path.txt (this file will have the path to your game.log file and can be manually edited if you wish)
	|_killfeed.txt (this file will be created by the program it is related only to kills and vehicle destuctions)



the program will have a system tray icon with black square and "EP" located near your clock in the bottom right of your windows desktop.
the lock position option is toggle and is locked when a tick appears and unlocked when no tick is present.
when unlocked you will be able to move the onscreen text overlay to anywhere on your screen. and the lock will make it stay in place to avoid accident movement.

the exit option will close the program.
